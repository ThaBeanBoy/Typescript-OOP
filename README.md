## Introduction

This is largely based on the [Typescript Object Orientated Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-object-oriented-programming/) course that is on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). I already have experience with typescript, so the course wasn't challenging. The only thing I did not understanding is the difference between `extends` & `implements`

The more exciting thing for me was the this was the first time learning & using a testing framework. 

The following concepts were covered:

- Classes & Objects
- Constructor & class properties
- Methods
- Getters & Setters
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Accessability modifiers

## Setup

### Vite

The reason why I used vite is because I didn't want to install [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & manually configure it, make changges to the package.json scripts etc... Honestly I was just feeling lazy. So I looked for something that would just provided full trypescript support from the word go. 

running the following command

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

will result in [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) asking us what type of project we would like to initialise. I simply picked vanilla with typescript, & it generated the everything needed for the prooject.

### Google Typescript Style

I eventaully installed [Google TypeScript Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) because I didn't want to worry about how the code looked, I just wanted a linter that will force consistency. Unfortunately, I noticed that my Prettier extension in VSCode wasn't formatting after installation of [gts](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)

### Vitest

I recently experienced testing in java applications, that made me realise the importance of testing. Unlike manually testing, which I used to do 🥲, test are like scripts that test your code. In this case, it was unit testing. I majorly tested on the Rectangle & Circle class.

The test framework I used was [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) because of 2 reasons:

- It supports ES Modules right out of the ox, with no configuration required.
- It supports Typescript right out of the ox, with no configuration required.
