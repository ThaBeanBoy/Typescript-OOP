## Introduction

This is largely based on the [Typescript Object Orientated Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/typescript-object-oriented-programming/) course that is on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). I already have experience with typescript, so the course wasn't challenging. The only thing I did not understanding is the difference between `extends` & `implements`

The more exciting thing for me was the this was the first time learning & using a testing library. 

The following concepts were covered:

- Classes & Objects
- Constructor & class properties
- Methods
- Getters & Setters
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Accessability modifiers
